QUESTION:
  Out of the given list, which Gene is associated with estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer and lung carcinoma. Given list is:  ABCG2,  GATA3,  TP53, TERT, PLA2G6

CORRECT ANSWER:
  TERT

LLM ANSWER:
  Based on the context provided, none of the genes listed (ABCG2, GATA3, TP53, TERT, PLA2G6) are explicitly mentioned as being associated with both estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer and lung carcinoma. The context only provides associations of variants with breast cancer and lung carcinoma, and some genes with lung carcinoma (BRCA2, CYP2A6, MIR616, MIR558). Therefore, it's not possible to determine the correct answer from the given information.

QUESTION:
  Out of the given list, which Variant is associated with skin sensitivity to sun and age-related hearing impairment. Given list is:  rs61815704, rs4149909,  rs36001488,  rs1333047, rs1126809

CORRECT ANSWER:
  rs1126809

LLM ANSWER:
  Based on the provided context, there is no information about variants associated with both skin sensitivity to the sun and age-related hearing impairment. The context only specifies that UV-sensitive syndrome (a skin disease) is associated with being an autosomal recessive disease, and lists variants associated with sensorineural hearing loss. Therefore, it's impossible to determine which of the listed variants is associated with both phenotypes.

CORRECT ANSWER:
  rs6679677

LLM ANSWER:
  Based on the provided context, none of the variants listed (rs2812378, rs17145188, rs12931267, rs6679677, rs12413409) are directly mentioned as being associated with vasculitis or keratinocyte carcinoma. The context only specifies associations for rs544276945, rs3743841, and rs1555330577 with vasculitis. Therefore, I cannot determine if any of the listed variants are associated with anti-neutrophil antibody associated vasculitis and keratinocyte carcinoma.
